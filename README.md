# To my best pal, Busser
Where do I begin?

I loved you ever since the beginning. The day you arrived you gave me the biggest and most honest smile I've ever seen in my gloomy existence.

Because that's how I feel now, surrounded by gloom.

Why now?, why now?, why? why?? why???

Please don't. Why were you not playful yesterday?

Why did you give me that faint stare today?

I wish we had more time to spend together, bud.

Why's life so short?

We went on walks, and you enjoyed it.

We went to play, and I treasured it.

#### I'm sorry I wasn't enough for you
#### I'm sorry I didn't do more for you

But you're what I cherished the most.

I'd give everything I have, just for 30 more minutes with you.

To play with you, to caress you, to enjoy deeds with you.

## I promise you, I'll be better from now on

No slacking off, no careless actions

Because I loved you so much, I can't bring myself to be like this anymore

I can't waste a second no more.

### I hope to see you again

### I really do

Memories of you flow through my mind

You were always so nice, never ever bice
