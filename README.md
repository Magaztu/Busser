# To my best pal, Busser
Where do I begin?

I loved you ever since the beginning. The day you arrived you gave me the biggest and most honest smile I've ever seen in my gloomy existence.

Because that's how I feel now, surrounded by gloom.

Why now?, why now?, why? why?? why???

Please don't. Why were you not playful yesterday?

Why did you give me that faint stare today?

I wish we had more time to spend together, bud.

Why's life so short?

We went on walks, and you enjoyed it

We went to play, and I treasured it

#### I'm sorry I wasn't enough for you
#### I'm sorry I didn't do more for you
