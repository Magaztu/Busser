# To my best pal, Busser
Where do I begin?

I loved you ever since the beginning. The day you arrived you gave me the biggest and most honest smile I've ever seen in my gloomy existence.

Because that's how I feel now, surrounded by gloom.

Why now?, why now?, why? why?? why???

Please don't. Why were you not playful yesterday?

Why did you give me that faint stare today?

I wish we had more time to spend together, bud.

Why's life so short?

We went on walks, and you enjoyed it.

We went to play, and I treasured it.

#### I'm sorry I wasn't enough for you
#### I'm sorry I didn't do more for you

But you're what I cherished the most.

I'd give everything I have, just for 30 more minutes with you.

To play with you, to caress you, to enjoy deeds with you.

## I promise you, I'll be better from now on

No slacking off, no careless actions

Because I loved you so much, I can't bring myself to be like this anymore

I can't waste a second no more.

### I hope to see you again
### I really do

Memories of you flow through my mind

You were always so nice, never ever bice

My time with you was exceptional

Nothing and no one will ever replicate that

I know you can't talk, I know you won't

But I hope our time together was as precious to you as it was to me

Time did us apart, and so did D.

But I have faith, I believe that it won't last forever.

I remember blowing you face, petting your head, stroking your chest and scratching your legs.

Maybe even tickling your ears.

It's so vivid in my mind, but why can't I go back?

I shouldn't be so pessimistic, brand new days are ahead

But without you around, I don't know if I can handle them anymore

You were so unique and special

My head can't even put to words how smooth your fur was, or how bright your eyes were.

You were undeniably an interesting critter.

You were most undeniably my best friend.

### Please don't watch me cry

### Please comfort me with your claws

The marks you left behind.

I'll harbor them on my heart.

They are physical as well.

So you're not gone yet.

Time's running short.

So are my words.

As we approach the end.

Please, remember my friend.

I always loved you.

And always will.

# Until the very end.
